            <h3> Young Adolescent</h3>
        </section> By the time she was 17, Amos had a stock of homemade demo tapes that her father regularly sent out to record companies and producers Producer Narada Michael Walden responded favorably: he and Amos cut some tracks together, but none were released. Despite the disappointing reaction to Y Kant Tori Read, 
        Amos still had to comply with her six-record contract with Atlantic Records, which, in 1989, wanted a new record by March 1990. The initial recordings were declined by the label, which Amos felt was because the album had not been properly presented. The album was recorded in a church in Delgany, County Wicklow, Ireland, with Amos taking advantage of the church's acoustics. For this album,
         Amos used the harpsichord, harmonium, and clavichord as well as the piano </main>

            <h3>AdultHood</h3>
            <p>On November 18, 2016, Amos released a deluxe version of the album Boys for Pele to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the original release. This follows the deluxe re-releases of her first two albums in 2015.
                On September 8, 2017, Amos released Native Invader, accompanied by a world tour. During the summer of 2017, Amos launched three songs from the album: "Cloud Riders", "Up the Creek", and "Reindeer King", the latter featuring string arrangements by John Philip Shenale. Produced by Amos, the album 
                explores topics like American politics and environmental issues, mixed with mythological elements and first-person narrations.
                The initial inspiration for the album came from a trip that Amos took to the Great Smoky Mountains (Tennessee-North Carolina), home of her alleged Native American ancestors; however, two events deeply influenced the final record: in November 2016, Donald Trump was elected President 
                of the United States of America; two months later.</p>
