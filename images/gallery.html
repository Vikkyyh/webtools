        The tour kicked off with its European leg in Rome, Italy, on May 28, 2007, which lasted through July, concluding
        in Israel; the Australian leg took place during September; the North American leg lasted from October to
        December 16, 2007
        when the tour concluded in Los Angeles. Amos opened each show dressed as one of the four non-Tori personae from
        the album, then Amos would emerge as herself to perform for the remaining two-thirds of the show.

        Amos maintains that her great-grandmother, Little Margaret (Margaret Loraine Little) who, along with her
        husband, is recorded as white on the US census
        was Cherokee and evaded the Trail of Tears by taking refuge in the Great Smoky Mountains, her family's place of
        residence.

        Not long after Amos was ensconced with her new label, she received unsettling news when Polly Anthony resigned as president of Epic Records in 2003.
         Anthony had been one of the primary reasons Amos signed with the label and as a result of her resignation, Amos formed the Bridge Entertainment Group.
