            <h2> Cherokee influence </h2>
            <p> Amos references Native American culture, history and spirituality in her music and visual art. She has
                spoken about ancestors on her mother's side who claimed Cherokee decendents. Her maternal grandfather,
                Calvin Clinton Copeland, who self-identified; as Cherokee.
                She has cited him as a great source of inspiration and guidance, offering a pantheistic spiritual

            <h2> Young Adolescent</h2>
            <p>
                By the time she was 17, Amos had a stock of homemade demo tapes that her father regularly sent out to
                record
                companies and producers Producer Narada Michael Walden responded favorably: he and Amos cut some tracks
                together, but none were released. Despite the disappointing reaction to Y Kant Tori Read,
                Amos still had to comply with her six-record contract with Atlantic Records, which, in 1989, wanted a
                new record
                by March 1990. The initial recordings were declined by the label, which Amos felt was because the album
                had not
                been properly presented. The album was recorded in a church in Delgany, County Wicklow, Ireland, with
                Amos
                taking advantage of the church's acoustics. For this album,
                Amos used the harpsichord, harmonium, and clavichord as well as the piano.

            <h2> Adulthood </h2>
            <p>On November 18, 2016, Amos released a deluxe version of the album Boys for Pele to commemorate the 20th
                anniversary of the original release. This follows the deluxe re-releases of her first two albums in
                2015.
                On September 8, 2017, Amos released Native Invader, accompanied by a world tour. During the summer of
                2017,
                Amos launched three songs from the album: "Cloud Riders", "Up the Creek", and "Reindeer King", the
                latter
                featuring string arrangements by John Philip Shenale. Produced by Amos, the album
                explores topics like American politics and environmental issues, mixed with mythological elements and
                first-person narrations.
                The initial inspiration for the album came from a trip that Amos took to the Great Smoky Mountains
                (Tennessee-North Carolina), home of her alleged Native American ancestors; however, two events deeply
                influenced the final record: in November 2016, Donald Trump was elected President
                of the United States of America; two months later.</p>
            <p> On September 20, 2021, Amos announced her sixteenth studio album, Ocean to Ocean, which was released on
                October 29. The album was written and recorded in Cornwall during lockdown as a result of the COVID-19
                pandemic and explores "a universal story of going to rock bottom and renewing yourself all over
                again".[84]
                Amos embarked on a European and United States tour in support of the album in 2022, and is continuing to
                support the album with a European Tour in 2023.[85] Matt Chamberlain and Jon Evans will again feature on
                drums and bass guitar respectively, their first collaboration with Amos on an album since 2009's
                Midwinter
                Graces.[86] For the 2022 and 2023 tour, Amos was
                joined by Jon Evans and the drummer Ash Soan.</p>
